# Introduction

Measuring reef coverage is logistically challenging, hence the application of methods that can minimize effort and cover
large areas is of importance. 

# Methods

We used field and satellite imagery to estimate the area and perimeter of patch reefs in the Kaneohe Bay.

# Results and Discussion

We showed that field data was less variable than imagery data, which may suggest that observat
